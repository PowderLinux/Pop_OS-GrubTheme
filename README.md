# Pop_OS-GrubTheme
Pop_OS theme for Grub2 bootloader
____________________________________________________________________________

Pop_OS theme for Grub2.

Supported languages: Chinese (simplified), English, French, German, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Ukrainian.

I originally made this theme with the fonts that Pop_OS uses, but they didnt look good when I converted them to pf2.. If anyone wants to try them, they are located in a seperate repo 'Pop_OS-GrubTheme-Extras' along with the theme.txt's to match them.

Install:

Copy Pop_OS-GrubTheme folder to /boot/grub/themes >
(use 'sudo nautilus /boot/grub' to be able to use copy/paste in /boot)
(use 'sudo mkdir /boot/grub/themes' if you dont have a 'themes' folder)

Add the following line to /etc/default/grub > 
(use 'sudo gedit /etc/default/grub') 
GRUB_THEME="/boot/grub/themes/Pop_OS-GrubTheme/theme.txt"

Update your grub.cfg >
(use 'sudo update-grub')

If you did everything rite, you will see-
Generating grub configuration file ...
Found theme: /boot/grub/themes/Pop_OS-GrubTheme/theme.txt

Done
